# üö® Azure VM CPU Monitoring Alert Project

This project demonstrates how to configure Azure Monitor to trigger alerts when a virtual machine's CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold. This is a crucial real-world task for any Cloud Security Engineer, ensuring that compute resources are operating within safe limits.

## üîß What This Covers

- Selecting a VM as a monitoring scope
- Setting a static alert threshold for CPU usage
- Creating an Action Group to send notifications (SMS, Email, App)
- Receiving and validating alert triggers
- Monitoring overview through Azure dashboard

## üîç Real-Life Scenario

Imagine you're managing critical workloads on Azure VMs. One of the VMs begins consuming unusually high CPU‚Äîpossibly due to a misconfigured application or a brute-force attack. With alert rules in place, you'll be notified instantly via SMS/email, enabling rapid response before users are affected or costs escalate.
